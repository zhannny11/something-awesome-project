Setup
Step 1: Clone Project and Project Files
Clone the repository 
```
git clone <enter repository link>
cd something-awesome-project
```

Step 2: Generate a Master Password Hash
On 
On the first run, youâ€™ll be prompted to set up a master password. This password will be securely hashed using bcrypt with a unique salt.


There are "two factors" of authentication included within the program. There are two options. You have to make sure the second_FA_location variable is either commented out or has a string inside the main.py program. If you do want to have a second factor of authentication, then you need to include hash the master_password_hash and the second_FA.

Enter the master password hash inside the master_password_hash variable inside the master_password.py program.

Step 3: Connect to Docker Container
Enter in correct username, database name, and password inside the db_connect.py file.

Step 4: Run Main.py
Run main.py with all files inside the same directory.
